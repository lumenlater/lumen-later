# LumenLater BNPL Protocol Whitepaper

## Abstract

LumenLater BNPL Protocol is a decentralized Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) system built on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform. The protocol enables instant credit for users, revenue opportunities for merchants, and yield generation for liquidity providers through a novel three-party ecosystem powered by over-collateralized lending and automated risk management.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The BNPL Market Opportunity

The global BNPL market has experienced explosive growth, reaching $120 billion in 2021 and projected to exceed $570 billion by 2028. Traditional BNPL services like Klarna, Afterpay, and Affirm have captured significant market share but face several limitations:

- **Centralized Risk**: Single points of failure and regulatory risks
- **Limited Transparency**: Opaque lending decisions and fee structures
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Limited global accessibility
- **Merchant Integration Complexity**: Difficult onboarding processes

### 1.2 The DeFi Solution

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols have demonstrated the power of permissionless, transparent financial systems. However, existing DeFi lending protocols are primarily designed for sophisticated users and lack the consumer-friendly experience needed for mainstream BNPL adoption.

LumenLater BNPL Protocol bridges this gap by combining:
- The transparency and efficiency of DeFi
- The user experience of traditional BNPL
- The security of over-collateralized lending
- The yield opportunities of liquidity provision

## 3. Technical Architecture

### 3.1 Smart Contract System

The protocol uses two main smart contracts that work together:

**BNPL Core Contract:**
- Creates and manages bills for purchases
- Handles merchant enrollment and verification
- Processes payments and repayments
- Manages risk assessment and liquidations
- Distributes fees to stakeholders

**LP Token Contract:**
- Manages liquidity pool shares
- Distributes yields to liquidity providers
- Handles collateral for borrowing
- Enables governance participation

### 3.2 Risk Management Framework (MVP Implementation)

The current MVP implementation focuses on simplified risk management:

    Execute --> End3([BNPL Active])
```

**MVP Features:**
- Collateral-based approval (LP token holdings)
- Basic borrowing limits per user
- Grace period before liquidation
- *Future: Credit scoring, dynamic risk assessment*

### 3.3 Interest Model (Interest-Free BNPL)

Following traditional BNPL models, the protocol offers **interest-free** short-term credit:

- **User Interest**: 0% APR for on-time repayment
- **Repayment Period**: 14 days grace period
- **Late Fees**: Applied only after grace period expires
- **Merchant Fees**: Revenue comes from merchant fees, not user interest

**Revenue Model:**
- Merchant processing fees (1.5% of transaction)
- Late payment penalties (30% APR after grace period)
- Liquidation fees for uncollateralized positions

*Note: This differs from traditional lending protocols that charge interest from day one.*

### 3.4 Collateralization Model (Simplified)

**MVP Implementation:**
- **Collateral Asset**: LP tokens only
- **Minimum Collateral**: 111% of loan value
- **Grace Period**: 14 days for repayment
- **Liquidation**: Manual process initially

**Parameters:**
- **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: 90% (111% over-collateralization)
- **Liquidation Threshold**: Health factor < 1.0
- **Grace Period**: 14 days after due date
- **Liquidation Grace Period**: 28 days total before liquidation

*Future versions will include automated liquidation and multiple collateral types.*

## 4. Economic Model

### 4.1 Revenue Model

The protocol generates revenue through:

#### Primary Revenue Sources:
- **Merchant Fees**: Processing fees for BNPL transactions
- **Late Payment Fees**: Applied after grace period
- **Liquidation Penalties**: From undercollateralized positions
- **Platform Fees**: Various protocol usage fees

#### Fee Distribution:
- **Liquidity Providers**: 70% of protocol revenue
- **Protocol Treasury**: 20% for development and operations
- **Insurance Fund**: 10% for protocol risk management

All fees are distributed automatically through smart contracts with transparent, immutable rules.

### 4.2 Token Economics (Framework)

#### LP Token Utility:
1. **Liquidity Provision**: Represent shares in the liquidity pool
2. **Collateral**: Required for borrowing BNPL credit
3. **Yield Earning**: Receive protocol revenue distributions
4. **Governance**: Participate in protocol decision-making

#### Economic Incentives:
- **Liquidity Providers**: Earn yield from protocol fees
- **Early Users**: Potential token rewards and incentives
- **Long-term Stakers**: Enhanced benefits for committed participants

*Token economics will evolve based on protocol growth and community governance.*

### 4.3 Sustainable Growth Model

The protocol focuses on sustainable, long-term growth:

- **Bootstrap Phase**: Initial incentives to attract users
- **Growth Phase**: Organic adoption through utility
- **Maturity Phase**: Self-sustaining revenue from operations

*Specific incentive programs and tokenomics will be developed through community governance as the protocol matures.*

## 5. Risk Management

### 5.1 Credit Risk Mitigation

#### Over-Collateralization:
Every loan is backed by 111% collateral in LP tokens, ensuring protocol solvency even in adverse scenarios.

#### Interest-Free Period:
Loans are interest-free for the first 14 days, with late fees only applying after the grace period:
- 0% interest during 14-day grace period
- 30% APR late fees after grace period expires
- Merchant fees (1.5%) fund the interest-free period

#### Liquidation Mechanism:
Manual liquidation process protects the protocol:
1. Health factor monitoring
2. 14-day grace period for repayment
3. 28-day total period before liquidation eligibility
4. LP token holders can initiate liquidations
5. Liquidation incentives for community participation

## Appendix

### A. Mathematical Models (Current Implementation)

#### Borrowing Power Calculation:
```
Max_Borrowing = LP_Balance √ó 90%
Available_Borrowing = Max_Borrowing - Current_Debt

where:
LP_Balance = User's LP token balance (1:1 with USDC)
Current_Debt = Outstanding BNPL principal + late fees
```

#### Required Collateral:
```
Required_Collateral = Total_Debt √ó 111%

where:
Total_Debt = Outstanding principal + accumulated late fees
Collateral_Ratio = 111% (over-collateralization)
```

#### Late Fee Calculation:
```
Late_Fee = (Principal √ó 30% APR √ó Days_Overdue) / 365

where:
Days_Overdue = days after 14-day grace period
Late fees only apply after grace period expires
```

#### Health Factor:
```
Health_Factor = Max_Borrowing / Current_Debt

Liquidation threshold: 28 days after bill creation
Health factor monitoring for risk assessment
```

*All calculations use precise scaling factors in smart contracts for accuracy.*
